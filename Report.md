## Bhashini project selection: Round 2 Assignment

#### Attempted to solve backend custom API problem statement of using Bhashini APIs to create a custom API based on given structure
#### Result: Got the API to work using python requests module but failed to create a custom API using flask

This was my first time actually trying to use an API and as i had no previous knowledge of web development and its corresponding languages i feel it was quite a challenge to try and learn and implement new thing with pre-existing knowledge and known tools.

Even though I set out to build a custom API with flask, not having experience with it caused a few setbacks, so to submit something presentable i decided to just get the API working with the request module which i had started exploring recently and ended the Assignment there.
